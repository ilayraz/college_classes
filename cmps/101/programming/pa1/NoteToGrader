Includes extra credit problem to find 1000! written to a file called "factorial.txt".

Approach:
    apint:
        Storage: byte array where each byte is a digit. Sign stored in a seperate boolean
        Addition: digit addition with carryover
        Subtraction: digit subtraction with borrow
        Multiplication: long multiplication
        Division: long division
    aprat:
        Storage: one apint for numerator, one for denominator. Both are positive. Sign stored in a seperate boolean
        Normalization: Find GCD using euclid's method then divide both numerator and denominator by GCD
        Addition: a/b + c/d = (ad+cd)/(bd) then normalize.
        Subtraction: same as addition but negative.
        Multiplication: (a/b)(c/d) = (ab)/(bd) then normalize
        Division: (a/b)/(c/d) = (a/b)(d/c) then normalize
